MediSight ‚Äì AI-Powered Early Disease Detection Assistant
MediSight is an intelligent web application designed to provide users with instant, AI-powered preliminary health assessments. By leveraging a suite of machine learning models, MediSight helps bridge the gap between noticing a symptom and consulting a healthcare professional, empowering users to make informed decisions about their health.

‚ú® Key Features
Symptom Analysis ("Dockinator"): An NLP-powered chatbot where users can describe their symptoms in natural language. The model analyzes the input and predicts a potential condition from a knowledge base of 41 diseases.

Skin Cancer Detection: Upload an image of a skin lesion, and our vision model will classify it as one of seven types, identifying potentially malignant conditions like Melanoma and Basal cell carcinoma and assessing the risk level.

Tuberculosis (TB) Screening: Analyze a chest X-ray image to get a preliminary prediction of whether it shows signs of Tuberculosis or appears normal.

The model will not work in the vercel app link but if you want a demo of the model see it the following link.
